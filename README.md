# Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning

## Course Project: Reinforcement Learning (Monisha Jegadeesan, Shreyas Chaudhari)

The following risk-measures and algorithms are implemented for a gridworld with error states setting:

#### Risk-Neutral
* Q-Learning
* SARSA

#### Risk as the Probability of Entering an Error State
* R-Learning

#### Risk as the Euclidean Distance from the Nearest Error State
* S-Learning

The mapping between the risk measures, algorithms and code files can be found in algorithm_file_mapping.txt.
#### A detailed report on the analysis of these measures and algorithms can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SDbNAa5gieDZM0R0qwv_cUxMr_3Thcj7/view?usp=sharing).
