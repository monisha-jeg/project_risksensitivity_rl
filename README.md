# Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning

## Course Project: Reinforcement Learning (Monisha Jegadeesan, Shreyas Chaudhari)

The following risk-measures and algorithms are implemented for a gridworld with error states setting:

#### Risk-Neutral
* Q-Learning
* SARSA

#### Risk as the Probability of Entering an Error State
* R-Learning

#### Risk as the Euclidean Distance from the Nearest Error State
* S-Learning

#### A detailed report on the analysis of these measures and algorithms can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k_VP6LrwvLj6L1Am11AqNc_FoSp9gzQk).
